## Lets Fix Git

I need issues of git and then we will fix them

---

## Concepts

- Conflicts
- Rebasing
- Force Pushing
- Fast-Forward
- Submodules
- Precommit hooks
- Cherry-pick
- Git prune
- Merge vs rebase arguments
- Git UIs
- Documentation
- Git flow
- Commit messages
    - merge commit messages
- .gitignore

## Things that suck for Everyone

renaming files losing history
    - "use git mv"

fighting to be the first person who pushes to a branch

Having to listen to merge vs rebase arguments

Can't handle binary or JDSL or PDFs etc.

## Jokes

I want the opposite of a .gitignore
    - .gittrackme
    - you add tmp/ or node_modules/ here

All merge conflicts will be resolved by just taking the developer with the older Twitter account's changes

Cherry-picking apparently means:
    "suppressing evidence, or the fallacy of incomplete evidence
     is the act of pointing to individual cases"
Which doesn't make any sense, so we are going to instead rename this:
    - yoink

Git Flow is banned, and if you talk about it ever, you have handle all major feature branching merges on your own.

The default editor will now be a fully configured neovim, with telescope, treesitter, harpoon etc. all up and running.

Commit Messages are now entered in the form of madlibs:
    - It checks the number of files changes and has you fill in:
        - I really needed to change 100+ files because: _____________

If you call --force when trying to push to master, and a call with HR is automatically scheduled.

We need to unify theme, half is trees, with branches and trunks and pruning, and other parts are toliet themed. So I think we make it all bathroom themed.

submodules are banned from use. talking about submodules is banned. 

the only precommit hook allowed is one that tweets "I'm coding!"
